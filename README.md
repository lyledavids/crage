# 🪙 Crage — Trustworthy P2P Crypto Marketplace

> **Buy & sell crypto peer-to-peer with privacy-preserving verification and portable reputation.**

---

## 🚀 Problem

- P2P marketplaces (Paxful, LocalBitcoins, Binance P2P) suffer from scams, fake KYC and chargebacks.  
- Users must repeat full KYC for every platform, creating friction and privacy risk.  
- Reputation is siloed — traders start from zero on each new app.  
- Platforms struggle to balance compliance with user experience.

## 💡 Solution — Crage + Moca AIR

Crage is a **next-generation P2P crypto-fiat exchange** powered by **Moca Network’s AIR Kit** (Account · Identity · Reputation):

- **One-click login with AIR Account** — wallet, passkey, or email.  
- **Privacy-preserving KYC proofs** — prove you’re verified or from a certain country without revealing documents.  
- **Portable reputation** — every successful trade issues an **AIR Credential** you can carry to any other AIR-enabled app.  
- **Sybil-resistant identity** — one verifiable AIR ID per user to reduce fake accounts.  
- **Safer trades** — reputation badges and verified identities help users avoid scams.

- **Light KYC Verification:** Zero-knowledge proofs of identity or residency.  
- **Reputation Badges:** Trade history becomes verifiable AIR credentials.  
- **Offer Marketplace:** List buy/sell offers with payment methods and rates.

## 🏆 Why Crage Stands Out

- **Privacy-first:** Users control their data and share only proofs, not raw documents.  
- **Portable trust:** Build a reputation once and use it everywhere.  
- **Fraud reduction:** Sybil resistance and verified identities protect users.  
- **Compliance-friendly:** Supports KYC/AML without compromising UX.
